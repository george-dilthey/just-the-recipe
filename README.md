# Just::The::Recipe

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'just-the-recipe'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install just-the-recipe

## Usage

To use this gem, you'll need to obtain a free APP ID and APP Key from https://www.edamam.com. Once you have these, create a dotenv file and add these lines at the top:

APP_ID = {{APP ID}}
APP_KEY = {{APP KEY}}

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
