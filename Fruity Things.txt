Recipe: Apple Elixir Recipe
Description: This cocktail is an apple orchard in a glass, bursting with three layers of apple flavor from fresh sweet cider, 100-proof apple brandy, and fizzy hard cider.
Ingredients:
• For the Spiced Cider Concentrate:
• 4 cups fresh apple cider
• 2 cinnamon sticks
• 4 allspice berries, whole
• 1 teaspoon cloves, whole
• 2 teaspoons black peppercorns, whole
• For the Cocktail:
• 2 ounces Laird's Bonded Apple Brandy
• 1 ounce apple cider concentrate syrup
• 1/2 ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice from about half a lemon
• 4 ounces hard cider such as Samuel Smith’s Organic Cider
• Apple slice or apple chip for garnish (optional) 
Steps:
  1. For the Spiced Cider Concentrate: In a medium saucepan, combine cider, cinnamon, allspice, cloves and black pepper. Bring to a boil then reduce heat to a simmer. Keep at a simmer, uncovered, until reduced by 3/4, and consistency is viscous like maple syrup, about 2 hours. Strain and let cool to room temperature. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a month.
  2. For the cocktail: Combine apple brandy, spiced cider concentrate, and lemon juice in a cocktail shaker and fill with ice. Shake until well chilled, about 20 seconds. Strain into an ice-filled highball glass. Top with hard cider. Garnish with apple slice or apple chip if desired. Serve
